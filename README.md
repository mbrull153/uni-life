# Master in signal processing and machine learning for BigData project

http://www.mstc.ssr.upm.es/big-data-track

The following repository includes all the different projects I did throughtout my master studies, some are for fun and others were mandatory.  


**NOTE**: Github has some problems opening .ipynb  (jupyter notebooks), so there are some notebook that do not load. Apparently is a recurrent problem, so possible solutions:

**Solution 1**
1. Copy the ipynb github link file
2. Open this link on browser https://nbviewer.jupyter.org
3. Paste link on the nbviewer

**Solution 2**
1. Open google collab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb
2. Go to File>> Open notebook >> Select 4th option (Github)
3. Paste link on the box


## EDA projects üìã

- Spotify EDA

Basic projects to start with some common EDA analysis.

## Others ‚öôÔ∏è

- Text generation
- Face identification
- Researcher

## Full ML projects üì¶

- Fruits

It was one of my first full projects, there is barely no data cleaning, but a lot of EDA trying different graphs to get some insight data to decide which algorithms is more suitable. Then I have tried different algorithms for classification.

- OSA

Full project that involves data cleaning, EDA, data augmentation, feature selection and algorithms analysis. The project is in both R and python but fully complete in python.

## Full DL projects

- Sign language

Classification deep learning project based on images, it classifies the image that represent a letter in the sign language to its corresponding letter. Once the letter is classified it used to predict a word given most of the letters.

- ECG_Arrythmia

Deep learning project for a biomedical application: classification of different arrythmias. Comparing results using a CNN and a SOM (self organizing MAP)


## Search engine üöÄ

- Image search engine

Image search engine that tries to achieve best search by trying different image descriptor and similariy metrics.

- Tweet search engine

This project is one of the most complicated as it has a lot of text manipulation, cleaning text, clustering words, etc... It has two approaches, the search engine and the classification.

## Recommender system  üîß

- Book_recommender_system

Recommender system involving the simple recommender and the content based recommender system.

- Movie_recommender_system

This project is based on the book recommender and the tweet text engine, as it combines both works. We use three different recommender system, the simple and the content, similar to the book recommender, and the collaborative filtering as the new one. The content-based recommender has also some text manipulation.

## Tools üõ†Ô∏è

- Jupyter notebook
- Google collabs
