# Movie Recommender

The project is to design a full recommender system, involving all three recommender system:
- Simple recommender
- Content based recommender
- Collaborative filtering

The first two recomemnder system where designed in the book recommender, but for the content-based I have also incoporated some of the knowledge obtained in the tweet text engine for text manipulation.
The first two recommender are based in the same DB provided in github, but for the collaborative filtering I had to chose another one since we did not have the user scores.

Collaborative filtering is based on item scores or user score, based on the similarity between user or item.
⚠️ The data for this notebook is not available in github, if needed contact me.
